# ASCIIartConverter
Image to ASCII art converter 
Takes a given imgage, scales it to desired size and using the greyscale values of the pixels converts it into ASCII characters. The ASCII image can either be displayed line by line in the console or printed to a separete file. Works best with a dark background, for a light background the values for the characters in the asciify method must be inverted.
